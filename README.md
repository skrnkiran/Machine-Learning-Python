# Machine-Learning-Python
This project explores community behaviour and sentiment within Reddit Fortnite-related gaming accounts by combining network analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning.
Using Python, the project scrapes public Reddit data, analyses user interaction patterns, builds follower/engagement networks, and evaluates sentiment expressed towards brands, updates, and community discussions.

🔍 Key Objectives:<br/>
Map social connections between Reddit users and Fortnite brand communities<br/>
Identify highly connected members (influencers, hubs, bridges) within subreddits<br/>
Perform sentiment analysis on posts and comments<br/>
Classify discussions as positive, negative, or neutral<br/>
Highlight emerging themes, toxic behaviour, and trending topics<br/>

🧠 Techniques & Tools Used:<br/>
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)<br/>
Reddit API (PRAW) for data collection<br/>
NetworkX for graph modelling & visualisation<br/>
NLTK for sentiment scoring<br/>
Matplotlib / Plotly for reporting insights<br/>
Machine Learning models for classification & pattern recognition<br/>

📊 Outputs & Insights:<br/>
User interaction graphs showing community structures<br/>
Sentiment distribution across topics and threads<br/>
Keyword trends tied to sentiment spikes<br/>
Identification of sub-communities and behavioural clusters<br/>
